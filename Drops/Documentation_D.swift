 ### **🔍 Summary of Context and Outstanding Issue (For Another ChatGPT Thread to Explore the Solution)**
 #### **📌 Overall Context**
 The application is an **image rasterization tool** where users can:
 - Select an image.
 - Process it to apply various effects.
 - Adjust parameters using sliders.
 - Zoom into the processed image.
 - Share the final processed image.

 The **Zoom & Share buttons** are part of the UI that allow users to:
 1. **Zoom in/out of the image.**
 2. **Share the processed image.**

 #### **🎯 Expected Behavior for Zoom & Share Buttons**
 - **Inactive when no image is selected.**
 - **Active when an image is selected or processed.**
 - **Should remain active after processing, unless a new image selection clears them.**

 #### **❌ Current Issue: Buttons Never Become Active**
 - The **Zoom & Share buttons remain inactive even after selecting an image.**
 - The issue persists **even though `selectedImage` updates properly.**
 - **Processing completes successfully**, but buttons do not reactivate.

 ---

 ### **🔎 Debugging Steps Already Taken**
 1. ✅ **Checked that `selectedImage` updates correctly** after image selection and processing.
 2. ✅ **Confirmed `isProcessing` resets to `false` after processing completes.**
 3. ✅ **Ensured `ZoomShareButtons` uses the correct `.disabled()` condition**:
    ```swift
    .disabled(selectedImage == nil) // ✅ Should become active once an image is selected
    ```
 4. ✅ **Added debug logs to verify that `selectedImage` changes** (Confirmed in logs).
 5. ✅ **Checked if `applyProcessing()` properly sets `selectedImage`.**
 6. ✅ **Ensured `TopBarView` passes `selectedImage` correctly to `ZoomShareButtons`.**
 7. ✅ **Checked if the UI updates by adding `onChange(of: selectedImage)` inside `ImageInput.swift`.**
 8. ❌ **Even after all these fixes, buttons remain inactive.**

 ### **🔬 Possible Areas for Further Investigation**
 - **❓ Is `selectedImage` being overridden after processing, resetting to `nil`?**
 - **❓ Does `ZoomShareButtons` correctly receive `selectedImage` updates from `TopBarView`?**
 - **❓ Is the `.disabled(selectedImage == nil)` condition being evaluated properly inside SwiftUI?**
 - **❓ Could `selectedImage` be updating correctly in logic but failing to trigger a SwiftUI UI refresh?**
 - **❓ Is `selectedImage` being updated in `AppUI.swift`, but not actually passed down to `TopBarView` correctly?**
 - **❓ Could the buttons be positioned inside a container that prevents UI updates from taking effect?**
 - **❓ Could there be a SwiftUI state refresh issue causing `selectedImage` to update logically but not reflect in the UI?**

 ### **🛠 Potential Next Steps in Another ChatGPT Thread**
 1. **Manually verify that `selectedImage` is non-nil at runtime** using:
    ```swift
    print("DEBUG: Selected Image = \(selectedImage != nil ? "Exists" : "Nil")")
    ```
    - **If `nil`, investigate why it resets.**
    - **If not `nil`, investigate why `.disabled(selectedImage == nil)` still returns `true`.**

 2. **Manually check if `ZoomShareButtons` receives `selectedImage` correctly in `TopBarView`.**
    ```swift
    print("DEBUG: ZoomShareButtons received selectedImage = \(selectedImage != nil ? "Exists" : "Nil")")
    ```

 3. **Force a UI refresh in `ZoomShareButtons` using `id(UUID())`**
    ```swift
    .id(UUID()) // ✅ Forces SwiftUI to refresh this view when selectedImage updates
    ```

### ✅ Recent Upgrades Summary (2025-04)

- CenterImageSelectionCTA added to improve first-use interaction.
- Progress indicator is now not in TopBarView, instead it anchors to selected image geometry and has better progress increment granularity.
- PulseHint is conditionally hidden while sliders are open or progress is running.
- Progress increments automatically if stuck at 10%, and now only moves forward (monotonic updates).
