 Rasterization Pipeline for Image Processing
 Project Overview
 This project processes input images by converting them into rasterized dot-pattern images with customizable parameters. It follows a structured image processing pipeline that involves:
     1.    Image Posterization & Region Extraction
     2.    Rasterization of Individual Layers
     3.    Recombination of Rasterized Layers
     4.    User-Controlled Parameters
     5.    Data Persistence for Efficiency
 The pipeline ensures a seamless user experience while providing granular control over rasterization parameters.
 1. Image Posterization & Region Extraction
 Key Process:
     ‚Ä¢    The input image is posterized (converted to distinct grayscale/color levels).
     ‚Ä¢    The image is segmented into multiple regions, each corresponding to a unique grayscale level.
     ‚Ä¢    These regions are extracted and processed as separate layers before rasterization.
 Implementation Files:
     ‚Ä¢    Manager.swift: Handles posterization and region extraction.
     ‚Ä¢    PosterizationMethod.swift: Implements the posterization algorithm.
     ‚Ä¢    RegionSubdivision.swift: Extracts distinct image regions for processing.
 Relevant Code (Region Extraction)
 let posterizedImage = regionProcessor.posterize(image, layers: layers)
 let regions = regionSubdivider.extractRegions(from: posterizedImage, layers: layers)
     ‚Ä¢    Posterizes the image.
     ‚Ä¢    Extracts regions to be individually processed.
 2. Rasterization of Individual Layers
 Each extracted image region is converted into a dot pattern, based on user-defined parameters.
 Key Parameters for Rasterization
     ‚Ä¢    Dot Size (dotSizeFactor): Controls the size of dots in rasterization.
     ‚Ä¢    Spacing (spacing): Determines the distance between dots.
     ‚Ä¢    Cluster Size (clusterSize): Defines the grouping of dots.
     ‚Ä¢    Intensity & Color Acceleration (intensityAcceleration, colorAcceleration): Modify contrast & color mapping.
 Implementation Files:
     ‚Ä¢    RasterizationPreviewModel.swift: Core logic for rasterizing extracted image regions.
     ‚Ä¢    CircleRasterization.swift: Implements the dot pattern generation algorithm.
 Relevant Code (Rasterization)
 let rasterizedImage = rasterizer.generateDotPattern(
     for: validRegion,
     targetSize: fullSize,
     dotSize: layerDotSize,
     spacing: layerSpacing,
     intensityAcceleration: intensityAcceleration,
     colorAcceleration: colorAcc,
     dotSizeFactor: dotSizeFactor,
     clusterSize: clusterSize
 )
     ‚Ä¢    Each extracted region is rasterized into a dot-based pattern.
     ‚Ä¢    The dot pattern parameters are user-controlled.
 3. Recombination of Rasterized Layers
 Once individual rasterized layers are generated, they are merged into a final composite image.
 Implementation Files:
     ‚Ä¢    RegionManager.swift: Handles recombination of processed rasterized layers.
     ‚Ä¢    RasterizationPreviewModel.swift: Calls recombineRegions() to merge rasterized layers.
 Relevant Code (Recombination)
 return regionManager.recombineRegions(rasterizedImages, fullSize: fullSize)
     ‚Ä¢    The rasterized layers are merged into a final output image.
 4. User-Controlled Parameters
 The user can adjust key processing parameters via the UI.
 Implemented Parameters:
 ‚úÖ Max Size (maxSize): Controls the scaling of the input image before processing.
 ‚úÖ Layer Count (layers): Defines how many grayscale levels are extracted.
 ‚úÖ Dot Size (dotSizeFactor): Changes the size of dots in rasterization.
 ‚úÖ Spacing (spacing): Adjusts distance between dots.
 ‚úÖ Cluster Size (clusterSize): Determines how dots are grouped.
 ‚úÖ Intensity & Color Acceleration modify contrast and color tone shifts dynamically.
 Implementation Files:
     ‚Ä¢    RasterizationPreview.swift: Implements the user interface controls.
     ‚Ä¢    RasterizationPreviewModel.swift: Processes parameterized inputs.
 Example UI Code (for maxSize Control)
 HStack {
     Stepper(value: $maxSize, in: 512...3000, step: 24) {
         Text("Max Size: \(maxSize)")
             .font(.headline)
             .frame(alignment: .leading)
             .padding(.vertical, 5)
         Spacer()
     }
 }
     ‚Ä¢    Allows users to adjust maxSize dynamically.
     ‚Ä¢    The image resizing logic respects this value throughout the pipeline.
 5. Data Persistence for Efficiency
 Region extraction and processing are expensive operations.
 To avoid redundant computations, extracted regions are stored and reused.
 Implementation Files:
     ‚Ä¢    Persistence.swift: Handles saving and retrieving processed data.
 Stored Data:
 ‚úî Extracted Regions (to avoid repeated segmentation).
 ‚úî Contrast Maps (to apply consistent contrast levels).
 ‚úî Intensity Maps (to track shading intensity).
 Relevant Code (Saving & Loading)
 Persistence.shared.storeRegions(self.extractedRegions)
 let storedRegions = Persistence.shared.retrieveRegions()
     ‚Ä¢    Previously extracted regions are reused if available.
     ‚Ä¢    Ensures faster processing on parameter adjustments.
 Debugging & Logging
 Comprehensive debug logs track each stage of processing.
 Key Debug Messages
 ‚úÖ ‚Äúüü° DEBUG: User-defined maxSize:‚Äù
 ‚úÖ ‚Äúüü° DEBUG: Extracting Region - Input Size:‚Äù
 ‚úÖ ‚Äúüü° DEBUG: Rasterization Target Size:‚Äù
 ‚úÖ ‚Äú‚úÖ Rasterization Completed Successfully!‚Äù
 Example Debug Output
 üü° DEBUG: User-defined maxSize: 1850
 üü° DEBUG: Extracting Region - Input Size: 1850 x 1235
 üü° DEBUG: Rasterization Target Size: 1850 x 1235
 ‚úÖ Rasterization Completed Successfully!
 This ensures the correct parameter flow at each step.


 Next Steps: Refining Visual Output

 üîπ Dot Pattern Variations: Allow different dot styles (e.g., squares, hexagons).
 üîπ Color Mapping Control: Enable finer color blending options.
 üîπ Adaptive Dot Sizing: Adjust dot sizes based on local contrast.
