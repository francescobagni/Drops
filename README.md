# Drops | Designing and Prototyping with AI

**Drops** is a small, functional iOS image processing app, built as a hands-on exploration into how AI can support early-stage product and interaction design workflows.

The project focuses on a contained curiosity: How to bring the visual logic of print-based raster effects into the mobile screen and experienced directly through one’s own photo library?

---

## Project Goal

Investigate key questions:

* Does the role of early prototyping change when AI accelerates the build?
* Can design decisions benefit from being embedded earlier in a working medium?
* What gets lost or gained in the process?

---

## *Drops* iOS App

* A working iOS app with a complete flow from image selection to adjustable rasterized output to export functionalities.
* Built in Xcode, using Swift and SwiftUI.
* Coded with ChatGPT as a code generation and refinement partner.
* No third-party frameworks beyond standard SwiftUI/UIKit stack.

The UI:

* Touch based image manipulation UI to edit image parameters
* Adjustable sliders for contrast, shadow, dot size, layers; Monochrome / multicolor modes; Optional "print frame" output treatment
* Responsive preview
* Finger-lens interaction to zoom into the small scale of the visual effect

---

## Output

* **Visual play**: The core effect is not “correct” but expressive—focused on unlocking variation, not fidelity.
* **Small build, full system**: From first gesture to final export, it’s all one flow.
* **Still open**: Expand exploration on extreme parameters settings, and highly distorted outputs

## Not Production-Ready

This repo is not optimized for production use. The goal wasn’t to ship but to probe the process. Code structure favors clarity of exploration over reusability or performance.
